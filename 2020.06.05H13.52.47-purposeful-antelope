Years ago, when I was only twenty years old, Azra left the Nemesian Vanguard and Ashtan declaring that she would return in force to overthrow the leadership due to what she cited as hierarchical failures. She published her discrepencies in Public News 20673. As a result of this posting, I felt compelled to defend my house and homeland which prompted me to respond in Public News 20675.
